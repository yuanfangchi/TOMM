07/02/2022 11:46:17 PM: [ From /Users/YuanfangChi/IdeaProjects/KE_TFF_NEW/venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/keras/layers/rnn/legacy_cells.py:958: calling Zeros.__init__ (from tensorflow.python.ops.init_ops) with dtype is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Call initializer instance with the dtype argument instead of passing it to the constructor ]
